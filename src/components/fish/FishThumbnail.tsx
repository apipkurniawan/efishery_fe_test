        The pandemic has had a lasting impact on global food security. Around
        660 million people will still face the issue of hunger in 2030.

        contribute significantly to food security. FishFarmer believes that "The
        Future is Aquaculture".

        Using advances in technology, FishFarmer builds a systematic value chain
        for the fish and shrimp farming business, resulting in an integrated and
        sustainable ecosystem to strengthen global food security in the future.
